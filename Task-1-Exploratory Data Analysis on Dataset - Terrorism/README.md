# Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset

## Introduction
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a terrorist dataset can offer important insights on the hotspots of terrorism as a security defense analyst. 
You may follow the instructions in this readme to analyze the dataset and determine the areas or nations that have had the most terrorist attacks.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this readme, you'll need the following:

- Python installed on your system
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Dataset
For this analysis, we'll be using a [Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luTU7xBvI7QAGPbQMxEHcgKUi9d6UeP_/view) that should contain relevant information. 

## Steps

### 1. Import the necessary libraries
To begin, import the required libraries for data analysis and visualization

### 2. Load and explore the dataset
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explore its structure

### 3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps based on the specific dataset. This may include handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and converting data types.

### 4. Analyze the hot zones
Identify the hot zones by analyzing the geographical distribution of terrorist attacks. You can group the data by region or country and calculate the frequency of attacks in each region.

# The Analysis' Results:

### After observing many charts, Reached the following conclusions:

1. The country most vulnerable to attack: Iraq
2. The State most vulnerable to attack: Baghdad
3. The region most vulnerable to attack: South Asia
4. Most types of targets in attacks: Violent Political Party
6. The type of weapon most often used in attacks: Explosives
6. The year that witnessed the largest number of attacks: 2011
   
## Conclusion
By following this readme, you can perform exploratory data analysis on a [Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luTU7xBvI7QAGPbQMxEHcgKUi9d6UeP_/view) and 
identify the hot zones of terrorism. This analysis can provide valuable insights for security defense analysts in understanding the regions or countries with the highest number of terrorist attacks.
